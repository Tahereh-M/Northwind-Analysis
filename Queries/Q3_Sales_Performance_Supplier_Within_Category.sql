2- Supplier name
3- Supplier country
4- Their total revenue(rounded to 2 decimals)
5- Their total quantity sold
6- The average revenue per category (rounded to 2 decimals)

The list should be filtered by the following condition:

The supplierâ€™s total revenue must be greater than the overall average revenue (calculated across all suppliers and categories).

Finally, order the results by total revenue in descending order.
